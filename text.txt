meet.js (short)

Here’s how you can explain the `meet.js` file in simple and concise points:

1. **Purpose**:  
   - Defines a "Meeting" structure for storing data in MongoDB using Mongoose.

2. **Schema Fields**:  
   - **`meetingDate`**: Stores the meeting date as a required string.  
   - **`meetingTime`**: Stores the meeting time as a required string.  
   - **`emailIds`**: Stores a required list of attendee email addresses.  
   - **`agenda`**: Stores the meeting purpose as a required string.

3. **Model Creation**:  
   - Uses the schema to create a `Meet` model, representing the "Meet" collection in the database.

4. **Export**:  
   - Makes the `Meet` model accessible to other files for database operations (e.g., adding or retrieving meetings).

This keeps your explanation clear and to the point!




Socket 

In this project, **Socket.io** is used for real-time communication between the client and server to enable features like messaging, video calls, and whiteboard collaboration.

### Key Uses of Socket.io:
1. **Joining a Room**: 
   - `socket.emit('join-room')` sends user info to the server when they enter a room.
   
2. **Messaging**: 
   - Users send messages with `socket.emit('message')`, and the server broadcasts them using `socket.on('createMessage')`.

3. **User Connection/Disconnection**: 
   - `socket.on('user-connected')` and `socket.on('user-disconnected')` notify users when someone joins or leaves the room.

4. **Whiteboard**: 
   - `socket.emit('draw')` shares drawing data, and `socket.on('ondraw')` renders it on other users' screens.

5. **Screen Sharing**: 
   - `socket.emit('start-whiteboard')` is used to notify other users when someone starts screen sharing.

6. **Participant List**: 
   - `socket.emit('list')` requests the participant list, and `socket.on('lists')` sends it back.

7. **Leaving Room**: 
   - A `fetch('/home')` request is used to exit the room and navigate to the home page.

**Socket.io** ensures real-time updates, smooth interaction, and synchronization of events across all users.






script.js(short)

Video and Audio Setup
const socket = io('/'): Connects the client to the server via socket.io, using the root path.

const videoGrid = document.getElementById('video-grid'): Selects the HTML element where videos will be displayed.

var peer = new Peer(undefined, { path: '/peerjs', host: '/', port: '9000' }): Creates a new peer connection with a random ID to enable WebRTC.
WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication):
A technology standard that enables real-time communication (e.g., video, audio, or data sharing) directly between browsers or applications without requiring a server for transmission.
Commonly used in video conferencing apps, voice calls, and real-time data transfer.


navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia: Asks for access to the user's camera and microphone:

Streams video and audio.
Saves the stream in myVideoStream and local_stream.
Displays the user’s video on the page using addVideoStream.

Integrated Flow:

Capturing Media:
Accesses the user's camera and microphone.

Peer Connection:
Sets up WebRTC connections using peer for video/audio streaming.

Socket.IO:
Facilitates room management and communication, such as notifying users of new connections or handling disconnections.

User Interactions:
Handles calls, displays video streams, and cleans up dynamically as users join or leave.


Summary:
Sends a message when the Enter key is pressed.
Displays incoming messages with the sender's name.
Removes a disconnected user's video from the video grid.



whiteboard:
1. **Whiteboard**: Users can toggle the whiteboard with a click. They can draw using different colors or erase. Drawing data is sent in real-time via `socket.emit('draw')`, and received with `socket.on('ondraw')`.

2. **Real-Time Drawing**: Mouse events track drawing on the canvas. Coordinates are stored in **paths** and drawn using the 2D canvas context (`context.stroke()`).

3. **Toggle Video/Whiteboard**: When the whiteboard is active, it hides the video grid and shows the whiteboard. CSS changes control visibility.

4. **Peer Connection**: **PeerJS** sets up a WebRTC connection with a unique ID. Users join a room with `socket.emit('join-room')`.

5. **Messaging**: **Enter key** sends messages through `socket.emit('message')`. Messages are displayed with `socket.on('createMessage')`.

6. **User Disconnect**: When a user leaves, their video element is removed with `videoElement.remove()`.

This concise summary includes key concepts like **WebRTC**, **socket communication**, **DOM manipulation**, and **canvas drawing**.


Screen sharing

This code implements a real-time video conferencing system with the following key features:

1. **Screen Sharing**: Uses `navigator.mediaDevices.getDisplayMedia()` to capture the user's screen and replace the webcam video track in WebRTC connections via `replaceTrack()`.

2. **Video Stream Management**: Media streams are handled using `video.srcObject = stream` to display video and `video.play()` once metadata is loaded. Video streams are added to the DOM with `videoGrid.append()`.

3. **Audio Control**: Audio tracks are muted or unmuted using `getAudioTracks()[0].enabled` and toggled with `muteUnmute()`.

4. **Chat Window**: Automatically scrolls to the bottom with `scrollTop(t.prop("scrollHeight"))` when new messages are sent.

5. **Meeting Management**: Users can leave the meeting using `fetch()` and redirect to another page. Room ID sharing is done using a prompt with `prompt()`.

6. **Event Listeners**: Event listeners like `click`, `mousedown`, `mouseup`, and `mousemove` are used for handling actions like screen share toggling, drawing on a whiteboard, and managing media streams.

Technical tools used include **WebRTC** for peer-to-peer connections, **MediaDevices API** for capturing video/audio, and **DOM manipulation** for managing video elements and user interface interactions.



This code integrates Google OAuth 2.0 authentication into a Node.js app using the passport library and passport-google-oauth2 strategy.
Key Points:
Google Strategy:
Configures Google login with clientID, clientSecret, and callbackURL. Handles user info (profile) after successful login.

Session Handling:

serializeUser: Saves user info to the session.
deserializeUser: Retrieves user info from the session.
This setup allows login via Google and session persistence for authenticated users.




This code builds a **video conferencing app** using `Express`, `Socket.IO`, `PeerJS`, and `Passport` for **Google OAuth 2.0 authentication**.  

### Key Functionalities:

1. **Server Setup**:  
   - Express app (`app`) and HTTP server (`server`) created.  
   - `Socket.IO` (`io`) manages real-time communication.  
   - `PeerJS` handles WebRTC connections for video calls.  

2. **Google OAuth**:  
   - Configured with `passport` and `passport-google-oauth2`.  
   - Authenticates users and redirects to `/home` on success.  

3. **Meeting Management**:  
   - Routes:
     - `/meet`: Creates a random meeting room with `uuidV4`.  
     - `/meeting`: Loads the "schedule meeting" page.  
   - **Meeting Scheduling**:  
     - Saves meeting data in MongoDB (`Meet` model).  
     - Sends email reminders via `nodemailer`.  

4. **Socket.IO Features**:  
   - **Joining Rooms**: Users join specific rooms by `roomID`.  
   - **Chat**: Handles messages and broadcasts them to the room.  
   - **Whiteboard**: Real-time drawing shared across participants.  
   - **Participants List**: Manages and displays room attendees.  
   - **User Disconnect**: Removes participants on disconnection.  

5. **Room Access**:  
   - Dynamic routes (`/:room`) render meeting rooms with `EJS`.  

6. **Port Configuration**:  
   - App runs on `localhost:3000`.  
   - PeerJS server listens on port `9000`.  

This creates a fully functional **real-time video meeting app** with authentication, chat, whiteboard, and meeting scheduling capabilities.
